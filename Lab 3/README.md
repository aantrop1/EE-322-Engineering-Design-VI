# Lab 3- Python
## Setup and Install Required Packages
I used the following code to change to the iot/lesson 3 directory. 
```console
cd ~\iot
cd *3
```
I also needed to install the required python packages needed. 
```console
pip install jdcal
pip install astral
pip install geopy
pip install pytz
pip install psutil
```
